<h1>Inclusion and Diversity open office hours</h1>
<section class="news">
<p>Borrowing the concept from college or university where instructors set aside time to be available to their students, some of us in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/idcg">Inclusion and Diversity Community Group</a> are volunteering to clear our calendar for some <strong>free open office hours</strong> each month, invite people to stop by our virtual individual office, to talk to people from under-represented groups who would like to get involved at the World Wide Web Consortium but don't really know where to start.</p>
<h2>Ground rules</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>No sales pitches, please.</li>
 	<li>No homework. We'll do our best to help you in 30 minutes, but can't commit to taking on homework after the call ended.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Arranging time to speak with our volunteers</h2>
<p>Each volunteer has a preferred way to manage their time and arrange times to talk with people. The following table lists our volunteers and their preferred contact methods.</p>
